# Breast Cancer Classification with Linear Regression and KNN
This project uses linear regression and KNN algorithms to classify breast cancer based on features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirates of breast mass. The data set used for this project is available in the scikit-learn library.

## <b>1. Introduction </b>
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women and early detection is critical for successful treatment. Machine learning can be used to develop predictive models that can help identify breast cancer in patients.

The data set used for this project contains features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirates of breast mass. The goal of this project is to use linear regression and KNN algorithms to classify breast cancer as either malignant or benign based on these features.

## <b> 2.Dataset </b>
The data set contains 569 samples of breast mass fine needle aspirate images, each described by 30 features. There are two target classes: malignant and benign.

## <b>3. Methods </b>
For this project, we used two algorithms to classify breast cancer based on the data set. The first algorithm is linear regression and the second is KNN.
